# Epidemic_Predictor
Health care is one of the most essential parts of living. There have been a lot of cases where people die due to some minor disease which they are not very well aware of or do not get enough medication. Especially in remote regions and some under-developed countries which lack medical infrastructure, proper education regarding health issues and access to treatments. These occurrences are so sudden that health departments do not get enough time to plan strategies and come up with some kind of vaccination. Hence, resulting in immense loss of lives. Some kind of reliable early warning system which can give first-hand information about the probable occurrence would be really helpful.
